## RF1MH121867: NIPreps: integrating neuroimaging preprocessing workflows across modalities, populations, and species

- **Aim 1: Solidify and extend NiPreps infrastructure and middleware**
    - TemplateFlow: FAIR Sharing and management of neuroimaging templates and atlases
    - SDCflows: Integrating susceptibility distortion correction
    - NiTransforms: Integrating spatial transforms


## Middleware: TemplateFlow

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Templates and atlases are commonly used in neuroimaging research
- There is significant lack of clarity in the use of these templates
    - There are numerous versions of the widely used “MNI template”
- Templateflow provides programmatic access to a database of templates and mappings between them

- Python API clience:

## Middleware: SDCFlows


## Infrastructure: Architectural redesign

- Problem: fMRIPrep's "one size fits all" design has limitations for emerging use cases
    - Archiving preprocessing results requires balancing storage costs against possible use cases.
    - Including alternative algorithms requires custom code to integrate.

- Solution: Accept pre-computed derivatives and defer computationally cheap operations
    - Multiple template registrations can be archived, analysts may resample BOLD series on demand.
    - Deep learning segmentations and masks can be accepted, skipping fMRIPrep defaults.

- This approach is implemented in SDCFlows and is being generalized to other components.

  - Including cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification
  - Provides quality evaluation for CBF maps
  - Provides CBF quantification at the regional level using atlases
