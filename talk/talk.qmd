## RF1MH121867: NiPreps (NeuroImaging PREProcessing toolS)
<div style="font-size: 1.1em">
*... the overarching **objective of this project is to develop NiPreps**, a software framework to perform standardized preprocessing of diverse neuroimaging data.* 

- Aim 1: solidify the foundations of the NiPreps integration.
- Aim 2: enable integrative analysis approaches of heterogeneous data.
- Aim 3: accelerate the dissemination of NiPreps to the neuroscience community through hackathons and "docusprints".
</div>
:::{.callout-note}
## Why?
<div style="font-size: 1.1em">
In developing fMRIPrep, we learned about critical aspects of neuroimaging workflows.
NiPreps is envisioned as a generalization of fMRIPrep.

## TemplateFlow: FAIR sharing of neuroimaging templates and atlases

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Templates and atlases are commonly used in neuroimaging research
- There is significant lack of clarity in the use of these templates
    - There are numerous versions of the widely used “MNI template”
- Templateflow provides programmatic access to a database of templates and mappings between them

- Easy to use for humans and machines:

## SDCFlows: Susceptibility Distortion Correction workflows

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **SDCflows aims to provide a unified interface to susceptibility distortion correction methods**
    - Defines a shared representation model (B-Spline) for the field map 
    - "decouples" estimation and application steps (increasing modularity)

- Overhaul started early 2021 ([Esteban et al., OHBM 2021](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/gy8nt))
    - Faced many technical challenges
        - Requiring numerous bugfixes and "edge" cases
    - Developed new educational materials & Jupyter notebooks

## NiReports: New visualization tools from MRIQC
![](images/celine-carpet-improvement.png)
([Provins et al., ISMRM 2022](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/hz52v))

- *MRIQC* is a quality control workflow for structural/functional MRI
- Developing a number of visualizations that will go into *NiReports*
    - Added visualization of voxels at the edge of the brain ("crown")
    - Added hierarchical sorting of rows (voxels) to enhance patterns (Aquino et al. 2019)

## Infrastructure: Architectural redesign
<div style="font-size: 1.2em">
- Problem: fMRIPrep's "one size fits all" design has limitations for emerging use cases
    - Archiving preprocessing results requires balancing storage costs against possible use cases.
    - Including alternative algorithms requires custom code to integrate.

- Solution: Accept pre-computed derivatives and defer computationally cheap operations
    - E.g., Deep learning segmentations and masks can be accepted, skipping fMRIPrep defaults.
    - Multiple template registrations can be archived, analysts may resample BOLD series to different spaces on demand.

- This approach is implemented in SDCFlows and is being generalized to other components.

## SDCFlows in a nutshell

- **What?** Wraps or implements methods for **estimating** field maps in various scenarios:
    - covering (i) so-called *TOPUP*, (ii) phase-difference fieldmaps and their variants, (iii) *fMRIPrep*'s "fieldmapless"; but
    - it does not cover point-spread-function approaches (extremely marginal).

- **How?**
    - Defines a shared representation model (B-Spline) for the field map (comparability ↑↑, methodological variability ↓↓)
    - Technical perk: "decouples" estimation and application steps (modularity ↑↑, methodological variability ↑).

- **Why?**
    - A single tool can be applied to correct for distortion, no matter how it was estimated (method comparability ↑↑)
    - The model coefficients can easily be moved with head motion (e.g., dynamic fieldmap)
    - The model coefficients can easily be integrated in spatial transformation chains (one-shot interpolation)
    - The model coefficients can easily be integrated within other software (e.g., eddymotion)


## Result YR1: NiRodents

::: {.column width="50%"}
- MRIQC-rodents saw a first release presented in EMIM 2022
- fMRIPrep-rodents is currently integrating new SDCFlows' API
- NiRodents has stimulated several improvements of the reporting system (see next)
- NiRodents has stimulated the inclusion (and revision of existing) rodent templates in TemplateFlow

## Result YR1: new visualizations in MRIQC and fMRIPrep
![](images/celine-carpet-improvement.png)
([Provins et al., ISMRM 2022](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/hz52v))

- Added visualization of voxels at the edge of the brain ("crown")
- Added hierarchical sorting of rows (voxels) to enhance patterns (Aquino et al. 2019)
- fMRIPrep: added "edge" regressors (Patriat et al. 2008)

## Results YR1: Other areas

- NiReports: provides standard mechanisms to build "reportlets" and full reports.
    - A repository has been initiated
    - Code already exists, but it is scattered across tools (e.g., MRIQC, fMRIPrep)
    - In the OHBM Hackathon, work initiated for moving MRIQC visual components into it (fMRIPrep will follow).

- NiTransforms:
    - The component is in a stable status
    - The component is key to achieving a redesign of fMRIPrep (described next)
