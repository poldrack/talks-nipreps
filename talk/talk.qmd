## RF1MH121867: NiPreps (NeuroImaging PREProcessing toolS)

**Title**: *NiPreps: integrating neuroimaging preprocessing workflows across modalities, populations, and species*

*... the overarching **objective of this project is to develop NiPreps**, a software framework to perform standardized preprocessing of diverse neuroimaging data.* 

- Aim 1: solidify the foundations of the NiPreps integration.
- Aim 2: enable integrative analysis approaches of heterogeneous data.
- Aim 3: accelerate the dissemination of NiPreps to the neuroscience community through hackathons and "docusprints".

:::{.callout-note}
## Why?

In developing fMRIPrep, we learned critical aspects of the fMRI neuroimaging workflows.
NiPreps is envisioned as a generalization of fMRIPrep.

## Towards a new design pattern for fMRI preprocessing: fMRIPrep

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
<div style="font-size: 1.1em">
- **A robust workflow for preprocessing fMRI data**
  - Tested on a large number of fMRI datasets from OpenNeuro
  - BIDS allows fMRIPrep to adapt to each dataset and process it in the best way possible
  - BIDS-Derivatives allows fMRIPrep to remain "analysis-agnostic" (works as a common interface for downstream analyses)
  - Provides powerful visualizations ("individual reports"):
      - to help identify problems (QC of methods)
      - allowing glass-box access to training researchers ("knowledge scaffold")

## NiPreps: deconstructing fMRIPrep in reusable modules

![](https://www.nipreps.org/assets/nipreps-chart.png){.absolute top=75 left=150}


## Nurturing a new community

![](images/nipreps-community.png)

www.nipreps.org

## Aim 1: Solidify the foundations of the NiPreps integration.

In addition to maintenance across the board and infrastructure (e.g., website), this aim focuses in four specific elements:

- TemplateFlow: FAIR Sharing and management of neuroimaging templates and atlases
- SDCflows: Integrating susceptibility distortion correction (SDC)
- Modularization, and generalization of the Visual Reports System (NiReports)
- Integrating preclinical imaging into NiPreps (NiRodents)
- Spatial transforms integration (NiTransforms)


## Result YR1: TemplateFlow is mature

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Templates and atlases are commonly used in neuroimaging research
- There is significant lack of clarity in the use of these templates
    - There are numerous versions of the widely used “MNI template”
- Templateflow provides programmatic access to a database of templates and mappings between them

- Easy to use for humans and machines:

## Result YR1: SDCFlows overhaul

:::{.callout-note}
## SDC is a significant source of analytical flexibility in functional and diffusion MRI processing
    - Multiple fieldmap sequences (spin echo, gradient echo, scanner-reconstructed $B_0$ maps), and combinations thereof
    - Multiple correction implementations with different data structures
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Overhaul started early 2021 ([Esteban et al., OHBM 2021](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/gy8nt))
- Faced many technical challenges → numerous bugfixes
    - vast amount of "edge" cases
- Opacity of the problem itself → educational materials
    - Jupyter notebooks
:::

## SDCFlows in a nutshell

- **What?** Wraps or implements methods for **estimating** field maps in various scenarios:
    - covering (i) so-called *TOPUP*, (ii) phase-difference fieldmaps and their variants, (iii) *fMRIPrep*'s "fieldmapless"; but
    - it does not cover point-spread-function approaches (extremely marginal).

- **How?**
    - Defines a shared representation model (B-Spline) for the field map (comparability ↑↑, methodological variability ↓↓)
    - Technical perk: "decouples" estimation and application steps (modularity ↑↑, methodological variability ↑).

- **Why?**
    - A single tool can be applied to correct for distortion, no matter how it was estimated (method comparability ↑↑)
    - The model coefficients can easily be moved with head motion (e.g., dynamic fieldmap)
    - The model coefficients can easily be integrated in spatial transformation chains (one-shot interpolation)
    - The model coefficients can easily be integrated within other software (e.g., eddymotion)

## Result YR1: new visualizations in MRIQC and fMRIPrep
![](images/sdcflows-notebook.png)
([Provins et al., ISMRM 2022](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/hz52v))

## Result YR1: NiRodents

::: {.column width="50%"}
- MRIQC-rodents saw a first release presented in EMIM 2022
- fMRIPrep-rodents is currently integrating new SDCFlows' API
- NiRodents has stimulated several improvements of the reporting system (see next)
- NiRodents has stimulated the inclusion (and revision of existing) rodent templates in TemplateFlow

## Results YR1: Other areas

- NiReports: provides standard mechanisms to build "reportlets" and full reports.
    - A repository has been initiated
    - Code already exists, but it is scattered across tools (e.g., MRIQC, fMRIPrep)
    - In the OHBM Hackathon, work initiated for moving MRIQC visual components into it (fMRIPrep will follow).

- NiTransforms:
    - The component is in a stable status
    - The component is key to achieving a redesign of fMRIPrep (described next)

## Infrastructure: Architectural redesign
<div style="font-size: 1.2em">
- Problem: fMRIPrep's "one size fits all" design has limitations for emerging use cases
    - Archiving preprocessing results requires balancing storage costs against possible use cases.
    - Including alternative algorithms requires custom code to integrate.

- Solution: Accept pre-computed derivatives and defer computationally cheap operations
    - E.g., Deep learning segmentations and masks can be accepted, skipping fMRIPrep defaults.
    - Multiple template registrations can be archived, analysts may resample BOLD series to different spaces on demand.

- This approach is implemented in SDCFlows and is being generalized to other components.
